# Spyce: A Python Standard Library Version in Haskell

## Motivation

The Python standard library is very nice.

It contains (almost) everything you could dream of, whose
interfaces are varying from average to excellent.

Also, Python is very much used as a starting language for
beginners.

The interface mapping will not be one to one, and this 
library is also conceived as a training ground for writing
consistent haskell code, eventually filling some gaps in 
the implementations.
