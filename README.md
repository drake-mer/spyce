# Spyce: A Python Standard Library Version in Haskell

## Motivation

Let's admit it: the Python standard library is very nice.
It contains (almost) everything you could dream of, whose
interfaces are varying from average to excellent.

Also, Python is very much used as a primary language to 
write various scripts and such things.

So this library could help people switching from a language
to another to have a more smooth transition.

The interface mapping will not be one to one, and this 
library is also conceived as a training ground for writing
consistent haskell code, eventually filling some gaps in 
the implementations.

# TODO

Everything :)
